    name: Use Texture Crunch Compression
    description: "<b>\u2022 What It Does:</b> Uses advanced compression to reduce
      texture file size and memory usage with minimal quality loss. \n\n<b>\u2022
      Our Modification: </b>Enabling Crunch Compression reduces load times and overall
      memory footprint, which is crucial for mobile VR.\n\nNote that crunch compression
      can produce some slight artefacts, while some textures, such as UI or fonts,
      need to remain precise. For this reason, we ignore Sprites (2D and UI) and
      Normal maps in the search."
